## Hello Everyone
I am Soumya Saha , an Undergraduate first year student pursuing BS in Chemistry at Indian Institute Of Technology. I have recently done a project on predicting the solubility of compounds using machine learning techniques. I have uploaded the dataset and the code for the project in my Github repository "wids_project-repo".
